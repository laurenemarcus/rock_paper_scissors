¡¡¡Rock Paper Scissors, the epic game of the ages of all time!!!
 (Pardon the flip tone. This is our first week of class.)

This file requires Ruby. We're on 2.1.2, but I'm not sure that's required.
This file also requires Sinatra. Please run the Bundler.
  Once you've got those ducks in a row, run Ruby app.rb

For these details/reasons and more, we recommend you simply...
  CLONE This Repository. (please read out loud to "Wheel of Fortune" cadence)
